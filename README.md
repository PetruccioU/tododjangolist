Studying Django
Here is a Django project of my 'Task Manager' website. During this project I've learned the basics of MTV Architecture Components (Model, Template, and View)
of Django framework, which is a variation of the MVC pattern. I learned how to describe a Model properly, how to make migrations, and how to migrate. I added an admin
panel. I created Views as functions, and as classes, I added a dynamic slugs to my URLs. 

Next steps to me are: 1)Get better with Django ORM. 2)Add a User-Login function to my website. 3)Connect PostgreSQL db to my website. 
4)Put my website into a Docker-container 5) Deploy my website on a AWS or Heroku cloud server.
